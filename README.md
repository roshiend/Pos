Sure, let’s consider an example where we have a product “T-Shirt” and it has two options: “Size” and “Color”. The “Size” option has values “Small”, “Medium”, and “Large”, and the “Color” option has values “Red”, “Blue”, and “Green”.

When creating a new product or updating an existing one, you would select the options and option values for that product. For the “T-Shirt” product, you might select all sizes and colors. This would generate the following combinations of variants:

Small / Red
Small / Blue
Small / Green
Medium / Red
Medium / Blue
Medium / Green
Large / Red
Large / Blue
Large / Green
Each of these combinations would be a unique variant of the “T-Shirt” product. For each variant, you could enter a SKU and a price.

When you save the product, the product and its variants would be saved to the database. Here’s how the data might look in the database:
Products Table:

id	name	description	price	created_at	updated_at
1	T-Shirt	Comfortable	20.00	2024-03-26 11:31:47	2024-03-26 11:31:47
Variants Table:

id	product_id	sku	price	created_at	updated_at
1	1	S-R	20.00	2024-03-26 11:31:47	2024-03-26 11:31:47
2	1	S-B	20.00	2024-03-26 11:31:47	2024-03-26 11:31:47
3	1	S-G	20.00	2024-03-26 11:31:47	2024-03-26 11:31:47
…	…	…	…	…	…
Option Types Table:

id	name
1	Size
2	Color
Option Values Table:

id	option_type_id	name
1	1	Small
2	1	Medium
3	1	Large
4	2	Red
5	2	Blue
6	2	Green
Option Value Variants Table:

id	variant_id	option_value_id
1	1	1
2	1	4
3	2	1
4	2	5
5	3	1
6	3	6
…	…	…

user selects an additional option, such as “Material”, and its option value “Cotton”, the system would generate new combinations of variants that include this new option.

For the “T-Shirt” product, if we add “Material” as an option with “Cotton” as its value, the combinations would now be:

Small / Red / Cotton
Small / Blue / Cotton
Small / Green / Cotton
Medium / Red / Cotton
Medium / Blue / Cotton
Medium / Green / Cotton
Large / Red / Cotton
Large / Blue / Cotton
Large / Green / Cotton

If a user selects an additional option, such as “Material”, and its option value “Cotton”, the system would generate new combinations of variants that include this new option. then existing variants sku and price should not be regenerated or cleard?

Correct, when a new option and its value are added, the existing variants’ SKU and price should not be regenerated or cleared. Instead, new variants should be created for each combination that includes the new option value.

For example, if you have a variant with the options “Size: Small” and “Color: Red” with SKU “S-R” and price “$20”, and you add the option “Material: Cotton”, you would create a new variant with the options “Size: Small”, “Color: Red”, and “Material: Cotton”. The original variant with just “Size: Small” and “Color: Red” would remain unchanged.

This way, you preserve the information of the existing variants while also creating new variants for the new combinations. This is important because the SKU and price of a variant may be based on its specific combination of options, and you wouldn’t want to lose this information when new options are added.

However, the exact behavior can depend on the specific requirements of your application. For example, you might want to give users the option to update the SKU and price of existing variants when new options are added, or you might want to automatically update the SKU to include information about the new option. These are design decisions that you would need to make based on the needs of your users and the nature of your products.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

when a new option and its value are added, the existing variants’ SKU and price should not be regenerated or cleared. Instead, new variants should be created for each combination that includes the new option value.

For example, if you have a variant with the options “Size: Small” and “Color: Red” with SKU “S-R” and price “$20”, and you add the option “Material: Cotton”, you would create a new variant with the options “Size: Small”, “Color: Red”, and “Material: Cotton”. The original variant with just “Size: Small” and “Color: Red” would remain unchanged. so thats mean, it will do something like this Small / Red / Cotton SKU “S-R price “$20” or  keeping Small / Red “S-R price “$20”  and generate mall / Red / Cotton SKU “S-R price “$20”

no i think correct way is if i have  existing variant with size small collor red and  it shoudl be one variant small/red with KU: “S-R”, Price: “$20” and if i add another option of matrial and option value is cotton then it should update to small/red/cotton with KU: “S-R”, Price: “$20”. for as we create unique combination of variant i think that is the correct way. what you think ?

Yes, you’re absolutely correct. If the new option and its value are applicable to all existing variants, then it makes sense to update the existing variants with the new option value rather than creating new variants.

In this case, when you add the “Material: Cotton” option, you would update each existing variant to include this new option. So, the variant with “Size: Small” and “Color: Red” would become “Size: Small / Color: Red / Material: Cotton”, and its SKU would remain as “S-R” and price as “$20”.

This approach ensures that each variant represents a unique combination of options and values, and it maintains the integrity of the SKU and price for each variant.
